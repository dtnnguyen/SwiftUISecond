### Second Swift UI

This is my second Swift UI app. It contains a vertical stack of images inside a navigation container.
A navigation title bar indicating the "question" word

Upon selection an image, an alert window will pop up to indicate the current score.
Score will be increased by 1 for correct answer, and decrease by 1 for wrong selection.
